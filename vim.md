# Vim
Show file tree
```
:Explore
```
Split screen horizonally and show file tree
```
:Sexplore
```
Split screen vertically and show file tree
```
:Vexplore
```

Just in case you didn’t know it, you can navigate between splits by hitting `control w + direction`, w as in window. `^wl` goes right, `^wk` goes up, and so on. I’m telling you this because not only NerdTree allows you to open splits, but is a split itself: you can navigate back into NedTree with `^wh`. The arrows work too. Also, you navigate through tabs with `gt` and `gT` to the right and to the left respectively. Yes, Vim support tabs.
